I hate myself for the title of this post, but it seems to fit. Truth is, I finished working on the main website back in May, and haven't been able to do anything since. I hope to be able to write more, whether its on programming projects, human-computer interaction, or personal experiences.

I'm starting my third year at UCI, continuing my undergraduate studies for Software Engineering and continuing my employment under UCI as a Tutorial Leader for LARC. I hope to find an internship either throughout the year or for Summer 2019.

Though my personal projects (currently, _SimpleGaming_) are more revolved around learning and getting accustomed to Java development, I plan to extend those to dive into Machine Learning. Possibly implementing genetic learning or simple artificial intelligence patterns to play games recreated, such as Brick Breaker and Minesweeper. Those two games are barely completed, but the project will be put on hold as the first quarter of 2018-2019 year has just begun.
