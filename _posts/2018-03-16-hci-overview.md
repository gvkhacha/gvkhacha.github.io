I recently completed a course at UCI regarding "Human-Computer Interaction." Generally, with computer science students, these informatics classes are considered to be "filler" classes, and not to be taken as seriously as the technical ones. This is one of the main courses that teaches that there is more to being a software designer and developer than writing code.

In the ubiquitous world of technology we live in today, most of the products that surround us in our daily lives are riddled with design choices that subconsciously make the product easier to use, or encourage us to use for a longer time.

We usually don't even recognize most of these choices. For example, most online shopping platforms look and feel generally the same way. 

* A search bar taking up a lot of dominance on the screen
* Cart on the top-right corner, along with account and others
* Lots of sections with highlighted items
* On a product page: 
    * A large picture to the left
    * A more-or-less empty middle (or not as important)
    * Buy now and add to cart on the top right

We might not realize it, but each of these design choices are a direct result of human-computer interaction research; for example eye-tracking studies that check where our eyes naturally begin and continue to scan a web page.
